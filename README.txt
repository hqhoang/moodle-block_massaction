This is the Mass Actions block for future versions of Moodle.

Created at University of Minnesota by the Custom Solutions team.

##### Please do NOT use the master branch of this repository to install the plugin! #####

Starting with Moodle 3.2, I will be creating and maintaining a version of this plugin
for each version of Moodle. For those of you using older Moodle versions, here is how
to find the version of this plugin for you.

If you are using...
--- Moodle 2.0 to Moodle 2.3
        Go to https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversions.php?plugin=block_massaction
        and download the Moodle 2.0 version

--- Moodle 2.4 to Moodle 2.7
        Use the moodle-27-master branch of this repository or download v1.2.10 from the
        Moodle Plugins Directory

--- Moodle 2.8 and Moodle 2.9
        Use the moodle-28-master branch or download v2.0.1 from the Moodle Plugins Directory

--- Moodle 3.0 and Moodle 3.1
        Use the moodle-30-master branch or download v3.0.2 from the Moodle Plugins Directory

Please see the README file for the respective version of the plugin for more information
and change history.


Project roadmap
